# README.md for all four tasks

## Requirements
For task 1-4, install parallel computing toolbox, before running task

## Stefanini_driver_task1and2.m
- Computes and provides visual for Figs 1A, S1A, S2A, and Figs 1B, S1B, S2B from the Stefanini paper
- Computes and provides visual for (Figs 1C, S1C, S2C and Figs 1D,S1D, S2D from the Stefanini paper

## Stefanini_driver_task3.m
- PopPK
- simulates the impact of variability in kcl,A (clearance rate constant of the antibody) and in Vr (‘rest of body’ volume) with 100 virtual patients.
- This assummed a normal distribution for both parameters, coefficients of variation of 50% for kcl,A and 25% for Vr
- This visualized the concentrations of VEGF, VEGF-VEGFR2 Complex, VEGFR2, VEGF-Antibody Complex for both tumor and tissue


## Stefanini_driver_task1and4.m
- PopPD
- simulated the impact of VEGF, VEGFR2 expression variability for 100 specific patients in VirtualPatientsTask4.csv
- This visualized the concentrations of VEGF, VEGF-VEGFR2 Complex, VEGFR2, VEGF-Antibody Complex for both tumor and tissue
